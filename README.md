**A condition monitoring smart phone application for electric machines**

Unexpected faults in electric machines in industry can cause long down-times and result in high costs. A smart phone application can be used as a portable condition-monitoring device for electric machines. The vibration and acoustic signal can be captured and analysed and any anomalies in the machine can be detected before a serious break-down. A successful app has the potential to be commercialized through Apple Store and Google Market.

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
